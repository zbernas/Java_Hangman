# Java_Hangman

The first file within the src folder is Hangman.java, this file contains code I created within the Eclipse IDE. 
The program is a simple non GUI based Hangman application

The second file is similar to the first however, this Hangman game uses static classes

The third file is a calculator application(non GUI) which adds, subtracts, multiplies or divides Roman numerals.
